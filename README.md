# HTML_Project-Cplusplus-tutorial-website

This is simple project that I have to make for IT Studies. I can't use React, because pc's at university mostly doesn't have node.js installed and only it crew can allow instalation.
Making such mess is not worth it, so I'm creating project in pure html, css and java script. And there will be no backend and no database. It should be just standallone site.

About:
I choose to make website that will help other students learn c++. I will learn how to teach too :D And this project will have my knowledge about c++ in its contend and html,css and js,
obwiouslly, in the code.
